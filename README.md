# The Secrets of Dyrt REVAMPED


This repository is for The Secrets of Dyrt REVAMPED.
It's a planned future project, so don't expect anything of this for the upcoming time.
I do have the desire to get Dyrt into a new engine to make it (hopefully) more robust for the future, and also making it portable to Linux. I also plan to set the user interface to the standard that Star Story, The Fairy REVAMPED and 63 Fires of Lung use. However some code that I can re-use will be recycled to save some work (as the new engine will be Lua based) it can be done.

In order to make sure some bugs the original game now shows do not pop up again, I already opened this repository to log these, so I can at least use the issue tracker to log these. Please note, it's NOT likely they will be fixed in the original game, no matter how critical they are. Some required tools I need for that are not really set up well anymore. Sorry.
